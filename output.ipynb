    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion backtracking is an algorithmic technique used to find all solutions to a problem by exploring all potential solutions incrementally. It involves calling the same function repeatedly with new parameters, diving deeper into the problem. Once a solution path fails (for example, when a queen cannot be placed in any column for a row in the n-Queens problem), the algorithm \"backtracks\" to the previous step and tries other possible options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursion** allows the algorithm to move step-by-step through a problem, progressing deeper into potential solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking** ensures that if a solution is not valid at any point, the algorithm will retract its steps and explore different possibilities from the previous level of recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Case** - When all conditions for a solution are met (e.g., all queens are placed on the board without conflicts), the algorithm adds the solution to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Termination Case** - If no valid solution is found after trying all possibilities, the algorithm ends that recursive path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Real World Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "``N-Queens Problem``\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic backtracking example where the goal is to place ``n`` queens on a ``n x n`` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.\n",
    "For each queen, the algorithm tries placing it in every column of a row, checking if the move is safe (i.e., the queen doesn't share the same column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal with other queens). If a queen can't be safely placed, the algorithm backtracks, moving the previous queens to different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking recursion will go through the process of trying different configurations for the queens and will use backtracking when a conflict arises (when a queen can't be placed safely). Which continues until either a valid configuration is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Algorithms used \n",
    "\n",
    "`Quick sort` & `Selection sort`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    " ``Selection Sort`` works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the element at the beginning of that portion. It continues this process until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    " ``Quick Sort`` is a divide-and-conquer technique. It works by selecting a pivot element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sublists—those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real World Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sorting might be used in applications like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``File Management Systems`` for large collections of files by name, creation date, or file size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Financial Data`` for random financial numbers for analysis, such as transaction amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Event Scheduling`` for dates for planning events, appointments, or deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity Comparison \n",
    "*May vary since this data was taken from a previous run*\n",

    "Both ``Binary Search`` and ``Interpolation Search`` are efficient searching algorithms used to find a specific element in a sorted dataset. The two differ in how they navigate through the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Search**\n",
    "- **Divide and conquer** strategy.\n",

    "- **Estimate the position** of the target based on the value.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Real World Problem\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Binary Search** (Stock Price Lookup)\n",
    "    - Imagine you are trying to find the stock price on a specific date from a list of sorted dates and prices. Binary Search is ideal here because the data is already sorted (by date), and you can efficiently find the price for any given date by halving the search space with each comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Interpolation Search** (Predicting the Value)\n",
    "    - For predicting values (such as sales for a given year), Interpolation Search is useful when the data is uniformly distributed. The algorithm estimates the target’s position based on the values surrounding it, offering a more efficient search for large datasets where the values are evenly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search** narrows down the search to the date of interest. This allows for efficient retrieval of the stock price on that date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpolation Search** estimates the position of the target year based on the years provided. If the data points (e.g., sales over multiple years) are evenly distributed, this search method will be faster than Binary Search in terms of comparisons.\n"

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "``Dynamic Programming (DP)`` is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It is particularly useful when a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization**: DP uses a bottom-up approach where we store results of subproblems in a table (or array) to avoid recalculating them repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal Substructure**: The solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller subproblems, which is the key property of DP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The problem can be broken down into subproblems which are solved multiple times, and these subproblems can be solved independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Real World Problems\n",
    "\n",
    " ``Fibonacci Problem`` involves calculating the nth Fibonacci number where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. DP helps to store previous Fibonacci numbers to avoid recalculating them repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    " ``Knapsack Problem`` is a classical optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a weight limit. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
